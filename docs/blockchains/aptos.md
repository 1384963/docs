# Aptos

Aptos is an open-source and permissionless, layer-1 blockchain network that is not compatible with EVM.

## Consensus

Cronos has the Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus. It operates on a modified version of the [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/) Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus whereby validators are vetted by other validators, and are awarded staking tokens based on performance factors. The Cronos consensus is referred to as PoA because new nodes require existing validators to authorize the provision of staking tokens to the new node validators.
